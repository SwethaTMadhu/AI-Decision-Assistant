# Commuting Decision-Making Project

## Project Description
This is a project which simulates the AI-based decision-making for commuting using propositional logic. It evaluates various commuting scenarios based on weather conditions, traffic, early meetings, strikes, and the possibility of working from home (WFH).

## Features
- Evaluates three different commuting scenarios.
- Outputs whether the user should work from home based on defined conditions.
- Uses propositional logic to make decisions.

## How to Run the Python Code
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the file named `logic.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where `logic.py` is saved.
5. Run the script using the command:
